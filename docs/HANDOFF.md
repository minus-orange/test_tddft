# TDDFT OpenACC GPU Handoff

Last updated: 2026-07-16

## Current State

- Branch: `tddft-openacc-residency`
- Accepted implementation baseline: `83a030c` (`Defer coefficient downloads across corrections`)
- Accepted result record: this documentation update
- Current source behavior: Step 34
- Rejected Step 31 implementation: `f8b6188`
- Step 31 rollback: `8ef55bb`
- Performance baseline: Step 34 median `113.561361074` sec

Step 31 reused `GDUMP1..5` mappings across the five TMEVL kinetic stages. All
three runs passed correctness, but the median was `129.250354052` sec, about
`0.1355%` slower than Step 28. It was rejected and rolled back.

Step 32 commit `13f9e98` added measurement-only timers around the density
rebuild after TMEVL. Run 01 passed both correctness checks. `RHOOFK` took
`14.509684` sec over 472 calls, `RHOGET` took `0.440581` sec, and the preceding
944 `tmevl_p_exit` operations took `2.819788` sec. `SUMCHR` was inactive because
`NPFL=0`.

Step 33 commit `b2a43c9` replaced only the post-TMEVL `RHOOFK` path with a
device scatter, batched cuFFT, and device density accumulation. All three runs
passed both correctness checks. The median was `116.124675989` sec, which is
`10.0335%` faster than Step 28. Run 01 reduced `frprmn_rhoofk` from the Step 32
value of `14.509684` sec to `0.729800` sec and reduced `fft_wrapper` calls from
43,949 to 14,685. The per-TMEVL full coefficient D2H remains intentionally.

Step 34 commit `83a030c` removed the per-TMEVL coefficient D2H and synchronizes
only before verified host consumers or at FRPRMN exit. All three runs passed
both correctness checks. The median was `113.561361074` sec, `2.2074%` faster
than Step 33. Run 01 replaced 944 `tmevl_p_exit` operations with 103
`frprmn_coef_sync` operations taking `0.638588` sec.

Step 35 traced the accepted Step 34 source revision `7567ae8` with Nsight
Systems. The diagnostic archive is
`nvhpc_cufft_1rank_02_STEP35_NSYS_01`; its `116.000924826` sec trace wall is
not a performance baseline. Both correctness checks passed. H2D was 44,166
copies and `32,307.014` MB; D2H was 5,348 copies and `5,592.769` MB. Compared
with Step 30, this confirms reductions of 28,320 H2D copies / `13,918.755` MB
and 30,105 D2H copies / `24,461.806` MB.

## Next Task Boundary

Step 35 confirms that `work2_` remains the largest repeated actionable upload:
4,720 updates taking about `3.728` sec in the OpenACC summary, including about
`1.264` sec of enqueue upload time. The fused nonlocal projector is the
dominant GPU kernel at about `5.830` sec over 9,440 launches. Direct GPU
generation remains high risk because it may increase YLM, VPJ, or EXTAU
traffic; the rejected B1 ownership experiment is strong evidence against
adding those mappings without eliminating more transfer than they introduce.

Before changing that path, design an ownership boundary that does not repeat
fine-grained lookup copies and does not alter the sequential projector update
order. CPU/FFTW fallback behavior must remain unchanged.

## Validation Gate

For every performance implementation:

1. Build CPU/FFTW fallback successfully.
2. Build NVHPC OpenACC + cuFFT with diagnostics off.
3. Run one 100-step correctness measurement.
4. Require normal check and relaxed compare to pass.
5. If run 01 is healthy, run 02 and 03.
6. Compare the three-run median with `113.561361074` sec.
7. Record and revert a change that has no performance advantage.

The A100 environment is operated by the user. Provide exact commands and wait
for the returned logs or screenshots before making an adoption decision.
